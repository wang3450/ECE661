## Dependencies
Many solutions in this repository ultilize a variety of python packages. It's highly recommened to use a conda environment to manage the packages instead of installing libraries system wide. Below are some commands to set up a conda environment.
```sh
conda create --name ece661 python3.8
conda activate ece661
conda install numpy scikit-image opencv-python pycopy-copy -c conda-forge
```
Should you not have conda installed, refer [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/conda) before proceeding with the commands listed above.
